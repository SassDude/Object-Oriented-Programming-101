### Inheritance
Inheritance is creating or modify new classes from existing classes. Allows code to be reusable as it allows that child class to use properties or methods from that parent class.

An example of this is the all shape classes will inherit from shape class.

### Polymorphism
Polymorphism is objects can have more than 1 form. A class has the same behaviour shares the same functionality as its parent. Polymorphism adds flexibility, extensibility and adaptability to programs.

For example, all shape classes inherit from the shape abstract and are defined as a single shape type. They are all stored in the same list of shapes in the drawing object.

### Abstraction
Abstraction is something that is only an idea and can only be expressed as an expression. There are no definitions to it as to hide the implementation details while just presenting the features. It shows information on what the object does instead of how it does it. The reasons for using abstraction is that reduces code complexing and only shows the essential parts.

An example of this is the clock just knows the counters that counts time and can only read the value and pass them the information to either reset or increment.

### Encapsulation
Encapsulation restricts access to some of an object's components. Data members-only accessed through getters and setters if they are private.

For example, the clock cannot function without the counters to track the time.
